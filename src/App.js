        My aim is to provide a safe and non-judgmental space for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings, and to help them develop the tools and strategies they need to overcome their challenges and improve their overall well-being. I offer a variety of counselling modalities, including cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and person-centred therapy, among others, to cater to each client's unique needs and preferences.

        In addition, I offer online counselling sessions for those who prefer to access counselling from the comfort of their own home or office.
